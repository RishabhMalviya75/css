    <h1><b>Thor</b></h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      Thor, known as Þórr in Old Norse, is the formidable god of thunder, strength, and protection in Norse mythology. 
      He is the son of Odin, the chief of the gods, and the earth goddess Jord. Renowned for his immense power and bravery, 
      Thor wields the magical hammer Mjölnir, which he uses to defend Asgard and Midgard from giants and other threats.
      His character embodies the archetype of a heroic warrior, often depicted with red hair and a bushy beard, symbolizing his fierce nature.

    <h2><b>Publication History</b></h2>
    <p>
       In Scandinavian mythology, Thor is the god of thunder, rain, storms, and fertility. 
       Thor always stood out among others, and on his eighth birthday, Odin gave Mjolnir, a hammer enchanted with extraordinary magic.
        However, he could get it when he proved that he was a worthy warrior. The way of becoming Thor, the valiant king, can be explained by twelve nodal steps that form one of the flexible maps of “Hero’s Journey” in plot construction.
         According to Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey, twelve points represent a repeating sequence of stages. 
       They are “Ordinary World”, “Call to Adventure”, “Refusal of the Call”, “Meeting with the Mentor”, “Crossing the Threshold”, “Tests, Allies, Enemies”, “Approach to the Inmost Cave”, “Ordeal”, “Reward”,
        “The Road Back”, “Resurrection”, “Return with the Elixir” (“Interpretations of Joseph Campbell and the Hero’s Journey” 1).
